1110 Oh look..a talking lump of refuse..how novel!
1111 Is that your BREATH..or did something die in here..now go away!
1112 I didn't know Slime could speak common..go back to the sewer before I lose my temper.
1113 I wonder how much I could get for the tongue of a blithering fool..leave before I decide to find out for myself.
1114 You need to prove your dedication to our cause before I can discuss such matters with you.
1115 Your loyalty to our ideals has yet been proven.
1116 I'm not sure I can entrust you with this information yet.
1117 Come back when you have done more to further our campaign.
1118 Someone with your skills is more suited to beetle slaying..now run along.
1119 I think I saw a gnoll pup you could probably defeat, a few miles back.
1120 It's much safer for you to spend time fishing than on a dangerous issue like this.
1121 This matter is far too advanced for you to handle..come back after you've slayed a few more large rats boyo.
1122 It would be beneath you to bother with such issues.
1123 You are too experienced for such a task.
1124 Someone of your abilities would be wasted on this matter.
1125 You should not bother with such mundane issues.
1126 I don't like to speak to your ilk much less sell to them!
1127 Time to die %3.
1128 I am now accepting quests.
1129 I am no longer accepting quests.

1149 Ahh..look, free entertainment. Can I have your stuff if you die??
1150 Hmm..I wonder who is going to win?
1151 It seems you two have a problem, better not involve me in it!
1152 I wouldn't fight here for too long if I were you!

1164 Members of your little "club" have ruined things around here..get lost!
1165 I don't have anything to do with your damned club..move along.
1166 Creatures like you make me sick..the things you do..get out of here Pagan!
1167 After all the things you've done..the things you believe in..leave my shop!
1168 Actions speak louder than beliefs, and I despise both your actions and all you believe in.
1169 Get out of here now!
1170 I am tolerant by nature..but infidels like you push me past my limit..get out!

1180 Your actions and history are a personal affront to all I stand for!
1181 I shall rid the land of another infamous villain!
1182 Your foul deeds have earned my contempt!
1183 Your intolerable reputation insults all in this realm!
1184 Your beliefs are an insult to us all!
1185 It's time for you to take your blasphemy into the next realm!
1186 Heathen! Unbeliever! Norrath must be cleansed!
1187 Your faithless devotion to a false god leaves me no choice!
1188 Your guild must be destroyed!

1609 Agnostics will not commit to a belief in
1610 the existence or non-existence of any deity.
1611 BERTOXXULOUS - THE PLAGUEBRINGER
1612 Followers of Bertoxxulous believe the only
1613 truth on Norrath is that everything dies.
1614 They view the decay of flesh as a thing of
1615 ultimate beauty.  The subtle purples of a
1616 fresh bruise, the almost iridescent yellow/
1617 green of an infested pustule, are but a few
1618 of the things that His followers relish. It
1619 is not surprising that many of His followers
1620 pursue the dark art of necromancy, for to
1621 them nothing is more desirable than to be
1622 surrounded by beings who, even in undeath,
1623 continue to rot and decay.  Do not take this
1624 to mean that His followers are suicidal or
1625 seek a quick death.  To the contrary, they
1626 wish to live long, painful lives, spreading
1627 their dark, diseased stain across all Norrath.
1628 BRISTLEBANE - KING OF THIEVES
1629 Followers of Bristlebane believe in having
1630 fun at the expense of nearly all else.  Bards,
1631 rogues, jesters, gamblers, and gypsies are
1632 all typical followers.  They are almost
1633 always very charming, clever, and witty:
1634 traits all His followers should strive to
1635 possess. Mischief in all its forms is
1636 encouraged.  Practical jokes are performed
1637 as if they were the highest rituals.  Very
1638 few of His followers are outright wicked in
1639 their desires, but it is best to keep at
1640 least one eye on your purse if they are 
1641 about.  And never let one deal you a hand of
1642 King's Court.
1643 CAZIC-THULE - THE FACELESS
1644 Followers of Cazic-Thule fear their Lord and
1645 believe that only by causing terror in
1646 others will they be spared His vengeful
1647 wrath.  They strive to beat down and
1648 suppress all hope.  Fear rules their lives
1649 and through fear they rule the lives of
1650 others.  Pain, misery, violence, torture,
1651 and living sacrifice are the tools of a
1652 Cazicite.  Many lizardman tribes are devout
1653 followers, but His number of humanoid
1654 patrons grows daily, a cold shadow slowly
1655 engulfing the bright spots of Norrath in a
1656 twisted nightmare of horror and pain.
1657 INNORUUK - THE PRINCE OF HATE
1658 Followers of Innoruuk include nearly the
1659 entire dark elven race, who regard Him as
1660 their 'Father'.  They believe that Hate is a
1661 creative force, or rather 'THE' creative
1662 force in the universe.  Creativity is born
1663 of destruction.  Love and kindness are tools
1664 for those too ignorant to know what they
1665 want or too cowardly to do what is necessary
1666 to obtain their ends.  It is only through
1667 the total disdain of one's enemies that one
1668 can gain true power over them.  Pity and
1669 mercy have no power when confronted with
1670 contempt and viciousness.  It is the honest
1671 belief of His followers that if they were to
1672 hate strong enough, they could destroy all
1673 of Norrath.
1674 KARANA - THE RAINKEEPER
1675 Followers of Karana believe in the absolute
1676 power of storms.  They worship the life
1677 giving power of the rain and respect the
1678 destructive force of a sandstorm or
1679 hurricane.  The followers of Karana are
1680 rural humanoids - farmers, ranchers, hunters,
1681 and the like. They will often offer shelter
1682 from the elements to strangers.  Many Karana
1683 followers live a nomadic lifestyle,
1684 traveling where the winds take them.  They
1685 are humble, generous people who value
1686 strength and honesty and brook no disrespect
1687 of Karana and His work for they know it is
1688 only through His wisdom and kindness that
1689 all of Norrath is not consumed in an eternal
1690 tempest.
1691 EROLLISI MARR - THE QUEEN OF LOVE
1692 Followers of Erollisi Marr cling to the
1693 belief that love conquers all.  It should be
1694 pointed out that while love is a generally
1695 peaceful concept, Erollisi's worshippers are
1696 not pacifists.  They would like to live in a
1697 world where everyone loves everyone else and
1698 violence does not exist but they are not
1699 naive enough to think that Norrath is that
1700 world.  They have passionate loves of people,
1701 places, and ideals, and are more than
1702 willing to fight and die to preserve those
1703 things.  The dream of every follower of
1704 Erollisi is to die in selfless defense of
1705 someone or something they love.  Many
1706 paladins hear the true calling of their
1707 hearts and follow Erollisi Marr.
1708 MITHANIEL MARR - THE LIGHTBEARER
1709 Followers of Mithaniel Marr believe that
1710 valor is what separates civilized beings
1711 from beasts.  His followers live by a strict
1712 moral code that prizes truth, honor, and
1713 charity.  They are champions of the
1714 downtrodden and the most noble of warriors.
1715 His followers strive to rid Norrath of all
1716 things dark and evil, often sacrificing
1717 themselves in this never ending quest.  They
1718 will not rest until the day when all of
1719 Norrath is cleansed in Mithaniel's light.
1720 They take themselves and their duty very
1721 seriously, and have little patience for
1722 mischief or mayhem.  Many paladins are
1723 devout servants of Mithaniel Marr.
1724 RODCET NIFE - THE PRIME HEALER
1725 Followers of Rodcet Nife take an oath
1726 to fight disease and death until one or the
1727 other finally claims them.  They are very
1728 generous and humble, asking little more from
1729 their beneficiaries than that they pass
1730 on the kindness to others.  They are not
1731 content to deal with the effects of disease
1732 and death after they occur and vigorously
1733 seek to destroy the sources of these evils.
1734 Healers and mystics are typical followers,
1735 but many noble rangers and paladins also
1736 have taken the Nife Oath.  They believe that
1737 through faith in the Prime Healer, the 
1738 wounded heart of the universe shall one day
1739 be mended, and death's dark shadow will
1740 never be seen again.
1741 PREXUS - THE OCEANLORD
1742 Followers of the Oceanlord believe true
1743 power lies in the vast depths of Norrath's
1744 oceans.  They believe that eons ago, life
1745 first formed in the murky depths and that
1746 one day, the oceans shall rise again to
1747 embrace the faithful and consume those who
1748 are unworthy.  The Oceanlord's servants tend
1749 to live and work near, on, or beneath large
1750 bodies of water.  They seek to spread the
1751 word of Prexus to all who will hear and
1752 defend the oceans and seas of Norrath
1753 against any who would cause them harm.
1754 Many sailors and fisherman are followers of
1755 Prexus.
1756 QUELLIOUS - THE TRANQUIL
1757 Followers of the Tranquil seek peace.  They
1758 are not strict pacifists, however, and will
1759 fight to defend themselves and those they
1760 care about.  The peace they seek is an inner
1761 one.  They wish to know all there is to know
1762 about themselves and the world around them. 
1763 They thirst for the knowledge of their true
1764 selves and strive to help others attain
1765 enlightenment.  It is through the sharing of
1766 this knowledge that they believe universal
1767 peace can be obtained.  If every creature 
1768 fully understood itself and its neighbors,
1769 there would be no need for conflict or war.
1770 Followers of Quellious typically follow a
1771 nomadic lifestyle, constantly questing for
1772 knowledge and hoping to find themselves
1773 along the way.
1774 SOLUSEK RO - THE BURNING PRINCE
1775 Followers of Solusek Ro believe in the raw
1776 and unbridled power of fire.  Fire birthed
1777 the world and in fire shall it be consumed.
1778 True aggressive action is the only way for
1779 one to obtain what is desired.  Power is
1780 gained by superior force.  Followers of Ro
1781 have little fear.  They are bold and brash
1782 and say what they mean and do what they say.
1783 Social graces are something they neither
1784 possess nor desire. They demand the respect
1785 of their peers and more often than not, earn
1786 it as well.  Those who seek true elemental
1787 power follow Solusek Ro, and thus many
1788 wizards turn to His burning embrace.
1789 BRELL SERILIS - THE DUKE OF BELOW
1790 Followers of Brell Serilis believe that the
1791 surface world is a waste of space.  They
1792 find true happiness in the caves, caverns, 
1793 and tunnels that perforate the belly of
1794 Norrath.  But this is one of the few points
1795 that all the followers of Brell Serilis can
1796 agree upon.  There are many different
1797 factions who all worship Brell.  The
1798 Runny Eye goblin clan claims that He is
1799 their father, much to the disgust of the
1800 dwarves of Kaladim, who know that the
1801 dwarves are the true children of Serilis.
1802 The vicious gnolls of Paw disagree
1803 entirely, for was it not Brell who sculpted
1804 them out of the sacred Clay of Cosgrove?
1805 Followers of Brell Serilis can be found,
1806 in one form or another, nearly anywhere you
1807 enter the Underfoot of Norrath.
1808 THE TRIBUNAL - THE SIX HAMMERS
1809 Followers of The Tribunal seek one thing
1810 above all else: justice.  While some claim
1811 to express this desire by pursuing careers
1812 as guards or magistrates, true believers in
1813 the Tribunal do not recognize the rights of
1814 any court on Norrath and enforce the
1815 Tribunal's sense of ultimate justice on the
1816 rest of the population.  Retribution,
1817 vengeance, and punishment are sacred duties.
1818 Followers of the Tribunal are methodical,
1819 patient and just.  They must be so, for it
1820 is their belief that if they punish an
1821 innocent, the Tribunal will pass judgment 
1822 against them, and doom them to an eternity
1823 of endless torment.
1824 TUNARE - THE MOTHER OF ALL
1825 Followers of Tunare believe that we are all
1826 Tunare's children.  The children of Tunare
1827 seek to help Norrath, which they believe to
1828 be a living and breathing being, to blossom
1829 and grow.  Followers believe that the world
1830 of Norrath gave birth to Tunare and from her
1831 all life has sprung forth.  Thus, by
1832 worshipping and protecting the land, 
1833 followers are paying homage and respect to
1834 the Mother of their Mother, who in turn
1835 protects and provides for them.  Followers
1836 of Tunare will fight to the death to protect
1837 nature in all its forms.  Many druids,
1838 rangers, and a great many elves follow the
1839 ways of Tunare.
1840 VEESHAN - THE WURMQUEEN
1841 Non-dragon followers of Veeshan believe that
1842 dragonkind is superior to all other forms of
1843 life.  They swear allegiance to the Mother
1844 of Dragons and often sacrifice themselves or
1845 their loved ones to one of Her children.  In
1846 return for this undying devotion, Veeshan is
1847 very protective and generous to her loyal
1848 followers.  Many humanoids have gained great
1849 riches and ancient knowledge through
1850 servitude to the wurms, but these gifts came
1851 with a high price...knowing that one is less
1852 than cattle to the dragons, and that they
1853 can take your messy life whenever it suits
1854 them.  To most followers of Veeshan, however,
1855 serving a deity is its own reward.
1856 RALLOS ZEK - THE WARLORD
1857 Followers of Rallos Zek believe in the
1858 survival of the strong and extinction of the
1859 weak.  The heat of battle is the only place
1860 enlightenment can be gained.  The universe
1861 was formed by conflict and in conflict it
1862 will end.  The victors will feast upon the
1863 remains of the fallen.  No respect or regard
1864 is given to the dead, for if they were
1865 worthy, their hearts would still pump blood
1866 through their veins and not upon the soil of
1867 Norrath.  Followers of Rallos Zek are almost
1868 exclusively warriors.

The Teir'Dal and their brutish underlings seem violently jealous of your superior intellect and mastery of things arcane.
2084  Through great magiks you are able to channel raw energy from the Planes of Power and Discord into spells of great destructive force.
2085 As a member of the Gatecallers
2086  Through great magiks you are able to summon forth extra-planar beings to do your bidding.
2087 As a member of the Craftkeepers
2088  Through great magiks you are able to enhance and protect yourself and your allies while cursing or beguiling your foes.
2089 Welcome to Kaladim, The Forge of Norrath!  
2090 As a loyal Cleric of Underfoot it is your duty to tend to the health and well being of all of the sons and daughters of Kaladim whereever their adventurous hearts may take them, even into the homelands of our most hated of enemies, the ogres of Oggok.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW DIFFICULTY
2091 As a loyal Paladin of Underfoot it is your unending crusade to rid Norrath of evil in all its forms, especially the Greenblood Knights of Oggok.  You follow a strict code of honor and loyalty and should never flee from a battle while your comrades fight on, for to do so makes you no better than a cowardly Teir'Dal.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW to MODERATE DIFFICULTY
2092 The rogues of Miners Guild 628 secretly operate the Mines of Kaladim.  From this base, rogues are dispatched all over Norrath in search of silver, gold, and gems.  While most of Kaladim suspect the guild exists, most look the other way because the 'miners' rarely rob other dwarves.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW DIFFICULTY
2093 The dwarven warriors of the Stormguard are stout and proud and willingly give their lives to protect Kaladim.  King Kazon Stormhammer demands and receives their undying loyalty.  It is expected for all dwarven warriors to adventure and bring glory to Kaladim through valiant battle with our mortal enemies, the ogres of Oggok.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of LOW DIFFICULTY
2094 Welcome to Neriak!  Dark and damp, Neriak is home to the sons and daughters of Innoruuk, the Teir'Dal.  
2095 As a warrior you are expected to join the Indigo Brotherhood, a guild of fierce Teir'Dal who support King Naythox Thex unwaveringly.  While you hold a place of respect and honor in dark elf society, the inferior races in their eternal jealousy, will attempt to kill you on sight in most cases.  If you must travel into foreign cities be sure you do so under cover of night and travel underground if possible.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE DIFFICULTY
2096 As a shadowknight disciple of Innoruuk,
2097 you are a respected and feared member of dark elven society.  You are allied with an organization of shadowknights and necromancers loyal to Queen Cristanos Thex known only as The Dead.  You believe that necromancy and the power of Innoruuk are the only true magiks and look down upon those who practice other arcane sciences.  While you hold a place of respect and honor in Dark Elf society, the inferior races in their eternal jealousy, will attempt to kill you on sight in most cases.  If you must travel into foreign cities be sure you do so under cover of night and travel underground if possible.  Sow your seeds of hatred far and wide and bridge the Ocean of Tears with fair elf corpses.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of HIGH DIFFICULTY
2098 As a rogue you are expected to join the ranks of the Ebon Mask.  It is forbidden for dark elf thieves to prey upon their own.  Many non-Teir'Dal cities have given their guards orders to attack dark elves on sight.  If you must travel into foreign cities be sure you do so under cover of night and travel underground if possible.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of MODERATE to HIGH DIFFICULTY
2099 As a devoted Priest of Innoruuk, you are a well respected member of dark elven society. While you hold a place of respect and honor in dark elf society, the inferior races in their eternal jealousy, will attempt to kill you on sight in most cases.  If you must travel into foreign cities be sure you do so under cover of night and travel underground if possible.  Sow your seeds of hatred far and wide and bridge the Ocean of Tears with fair elf corpses.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of HIGH DIFFICULTY
2100 As a practitioner of the dark art of necromancy,
2101 In spite of the fact that you have turned your back upon the one true art of necromancy you are still tolerated within the walls of Neriak.  As one of The Spurned, you have a slightly better chance of being accepted by non-Teir'Dal, especially among the Arcane Scientists, but this will require much work on your part and will insure that you are hunted and killed by your own people should you return to Neriak. @> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of HIGH DIFFICULTY
2102 For now.  As a necromancer loyal to the will of Bertoxxulous, the Plaguebringer, you are a valued member of the Bloodsabers.
2103 You have been denied permission to drag %1's corpse.
2104 Through the dark magic of death you are able to drain the life of your foes and raise the dead to do your bidding.@> This Race / Class / Deity combination is of HIGH DIFFICULTY
2105 As a member of the Dismal Rage and a loyal necromancer of Innoruuk, the Prince of Hate and father of the Teir'Dal, you will be branded as a traitor to your own race.  Beware of the Arcane Scientists, for if they discover your dark ways they will do all in their considerable power to stop you.  When they all fall before the might of Innoruuk you shall be vindicated.

4002 AGNOSTIC<BR><BR>Agnostics will not commit to a belief in the existence or non-existence of any deity.
4003 BERTOXXULOUS - THE PLAGUEBRINGER<BR><BR>Followers of Bertoxxulous believe the only truth on Norrath is that everything dies. They view the decay of flesh as a thing of ultimate beauty.  The subtle purples of a fresh bruise, the almost iridescent yellow/ green of an infested pustule, are but a few of the things that his followers relish. It is not surprising that many of his followers pursue the dark art of necromancy, for to them nothing is more desirable than to be surrounded by beings who, even in undeath, continue to rot and decay.  Do not take this to mean that his followers are suicidal or seek a quick death.  To the contrary, they wish to live long, painful lives, spreading their dark, diseased stain across all Norrath.
4004 BRISTLEBANE - KING OF THIEVES<BR><BR>Followers of Bristlebane believe in having fun at the expense of nearly all else.  Bards, rogues, jesters, gamblers, and gypsies are all typical followers.  They are almost always very charming, clever, and witty: traits all his followers should strive to possess. Mischief in all its forms is encouraged.  Practical jokes are performed as if they were the highest rituals.  Very few of his followers are outright wicked in their desires, but it is best to keep at least one eye on your purse if they are  about.  And never let one deal you a hand of King's Court.
4005 CAZIC-THULE - THE FACELESS<BR><BR>Followers of Cazic-Thule fear their Lord and believe that only by causing terror in others will they be spared his vengeful wrath.  They strive to beat down and suppress all hope.  Fear rules their lives and through fear they rule the lives of others.  Pain, misery, violence, torture, and living sacrifice are the tools of a Cazicite.  Many lizardman tribes are devout followers, but his number of humanoid patrons grows daily, a cold shadow slowly engulfing the bright spots of Norrath in a twisted nightmare of horror and pain.
4006 INNORUUK - THE PRINCE OF HATE<BR><BR>Followers of Innoruuk include nearly the entire dark elven race, who regard Him as their 'Father'.  They believe that Hate is a creative force, or rather 'THE' creative force in the universe.  Creativity is born of destruction.  Love and kindness are tools for those too ignorant to know what they want or too cowardly to do what is necessary to obtain their ends.  It is only through the total disdain of one's enemies that one can gain true power over them.  Pity and mercy have no power when confronted with contempt and viciousness.  It is the honest belief of his followers that if they were to hate strong enough, they could destroy all of Norrath.
4007 KARANA - THE RAINKEEPER<BR><BR>Followers of Karana believe in the absolute power of storms.  They worship the life giving power of the rain and respect the destructive force of a sandstorm or hurricane.  The followers of Karana are rural humanoids - farmers, ranchers, hunters, and the like. They will often offer shelter from the elements to strangers.  Many Karana followers live a nomadic lifestyle, traveling where the winds take them.  They are humble, generous people who value strength and honesty and brook no disrespect of Karana and his work for they know it is only through his wisdom and kindness that all of Norrath is not consumed in an eternal tempest.
4008 EROLLISI MARR - THE QUEEN OF LOVE<BR><BR>Followers of Erollisi Marr cling to the belief that love conquers all.  It should be pointed out that while love is a generally peaceful concept, Erollisi's worshippers are not pacifists.  They would like to live in a world where everyone loves everyone else and violence does not exist but they are not naive enough to think that Norrath is that world.  They have passionate loves of people, places, and ideals, and are more than willing to fight and die to preserve those things.  The dream of every follower of Erollisi is to die in selfless defense of someone or something they love.  Many paladins hear the true calling of their hearts and follow Erollisi Marr.
4009 MITHANIEL MARR - THE LIGHTBEARER<BR><BR>Followers of Mithaniel Marr believe that valor is what separates civilized beings from beasts.  His followers live by a strict moral code that prizes truth, honor, and charity.  They are champions of the downtrodden and the most noble of warriors. His followers strive to rid Norrath of all things dark and evil, often sacrificing themselves in this never ending quest.  They will not rest until the day when all of Norrath is cleansed in Mithaniel's light. They take themselves and their duty very seriously, and have little patience for mischief or mayhem.  Many paladins are devout servants of Mithaniel Marr.
4010 RODCET NIFE - THE PRIME HEALER<BR><BR>Followers of Rodcet Nife take an oath to fight disease and death until one or the other finally claims them.  They are very generous and humble, asking little more from their beneficiaries than that they pass on the kindness to others.  They are not content to deal with the effects of disease and death after they occur and vigorously seek to destroy the sources of these evils. Healers and mystics are typical followers, but many noble rangers and paladins also have taken the Nife Oath.  They believe that through faith in the Prime Healer, the  wounded heart of the universe shall one day be mended, and death's dark shadow will never be seen again.
4011 PREXUS - THE OCEANLORD<BR><BR>Followers of the Oceanlord believe true power lies in the vast depths of Norrath's oceans.  They believe that eons ago, life first formed in the murky depths and that one day, the oceans shall rise again to embrace the faithful and consume those who are unworthy.  The Oceanlord's servants tend to live and work near, on, or beneath large bodies of water.  They seek to spread the word of Prexus to all who will hear and defend the oceans and seas of Norrath against any who would cause them harm. Many sailors and fisherman are followers of Prexus.
4012 QUELLIOUS - THE TRANQUIL<BR><BR>Followers of the Tranquil seek peace.  They are not strict pacifists, however, and will fight to defend themselves and those they care about.  The peace they seek is an inner one.  They wish to know all there is to know about themselves and the world around them.  They thirst for the knowledge of their true selves and strive to help others attain enlightenment.  It is through the sharing of this knowledge that they believe universal peace can be obtained.  If every creature  fully understood itself and its neighbors, there would be no need for conflict or war. Followers of Quellious typically follow a nomadic lifestyle, constantly questing for knowledge and hoping to find themselves along the way.
4013 SOLUSEK RO - THE BURNING PRINCE<BR><BR>Followers of Solusek Ro believe in the raw and unbridled power of fire.  Fire birthed the world and in fire shall it be consumed. True aggressive action is the only way for one to obtain what is desired.  Power is gained by superior force.  Followers of Ro have little fear.  They are bold and brash and say what they mean and do what they say. Social graces are something they neither possess nor desire. They demand the respect of their peers and more often than not, earn it as well.  Those who seek true elemental power follow Solusek Ro, and thus many wizards turn to his burning embrace.
4014 BRELL SERILIS - THE DUKE OF BELOW<BR><BR>Followers of Brell Serilis believe that the surface world is a waste of space.  They find true happiness in the caves, caverns,  and tunnels that perforate the belly of Norrath.  But this is one of the few points that all the followers of Brell Serilis can agree upon.  There are many different factions who all worship Brell.  The Runny Eye goblin clan claims that He is their father, much to the disgust of the dwarves of Kaladim, who know that the dwarves are the true children of Serilis. The vicious gnolls of Paw disagree entirely, for was it not Brell who sculpted them out of the sacred Clay of Cosgrove? Followers of Brell Serilis can be found, in one form or another, nearly anywhere you enter the Underfoot of Norrath.
4015 THE TRIBUNAL - THE SIX HAMMERS<BR><BR>Followers of The Tribunal seek one thing above all else: justice.  While some claim to express this desire by pursuing careers as guards or magistrates, true believers in the Tribunal do not recognize the rights of any court on Norrath and enforce the Tribunal's sense of ultimate justice on the rest of the population.  Retribution, vengeance, and punishment are sacred duties. Followers of the Tribunal are methodical, patient and just.  They must be so, for it is their belief that if they punish an innocent, the Tribunal will pass judgment  against them, and doom them to an eternity of endless torment.
4016 TUNARE - THE MOTHER OF ALL<BR><BR>Followers of Tunare believe that we are all Tunare's children.  The children of Tunare seek to help Norrath, which they believe to be a living and breathing being, to blossom and grow.  Followers believe that the world of Norrath gave birth to Tunare and from her all life has sprung forth.  Thus, by worshipping and protecting the land,  followers are paying homage and respect to the Mother of their Mother, who in turn protects and provides for them.  Followers of Tunare will fight to the death to protect nature in all its forms.  Many druids, rangers, and a great many elves follow the ways of Tunare.
4017 VEESHAN - THE WURMQUEEN<BR><BR>Non-dragon followers of Veeshan believe that dragonkind is superior to all other forms of life.  They swear allegiance to the Mother of Dragons and often sacrifice themselves or their loved ones to one of her children.  In return for this undying devotion, Veeshan is very protective and generous to her loyal followers.  Many humanoids have gained great riches and ancient knowledge through servitude to the wurms, but these gifts came with a high price...knowing that one is less than cattle to the dragons, and that they can take your messy life whenever it suits them.  To most followers of Veeshan, however, serving a deity is its own reward.
4018 RALLOS ZEK - THE WARLORD<BR><BR>Followers of Rallos Zek believe in the survival of the strong and extinction of the weak.  The heat of battle is the only place enlightenment can be gained.  The universe was formed by conflict and in conflict it will end.  The victors will feast upon the remains of the fallen.  No respect or regard is given to the dead, for if they were worthy, their hearts would still pump blood through their veins and not upon the soil of Norrath.  Followers of Rallos Zek are almost exclusively warriors.
